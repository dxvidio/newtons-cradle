# Newton's Cradle Interactive Simulation

This is an interactive simulation of **Newton's Cradle**, a device that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy via a series of swinging spheres. This project is built using **TypeScript**, **React**, **CSS**, and **Matter.js**, a 2D physics engine for the web. The simulation allows users to manipulate the cradle in real-time and observe the physics in action.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Users can click and drag to set the balls in motion and watch the cradle swing.
- **Accurate Physics**: Leveraging the Matter.js physics engine to simulate real-world physics with collision detection and momentum transfer.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to work on different screen sizes and devices.
- **Customizable**: The cradle size, number of balls, and physics properties can be easily adjusted in the code.
